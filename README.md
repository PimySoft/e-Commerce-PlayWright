# E-Commerce Playwright Automation

A Playwright E2E testing framework showcasing best practices for web application automation, featuring Page Object Model (POM) architecture and modern testing patterns.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository demonstrates **Playwright E2E testing** capabilities:

- **End-to-End Testing** - Complete user journey testing through browser automation
- **Page Object Model** - Maintainable and scalable test architecture
- **Cross-Browser Testing** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge support
- **Visual Regression Testing** - Percy AI-powered visual comparison
- **TypeScript & Fixtures** - Type-safe tests with custom fixtures for clean code

## 🚀 Test Coverage

- **Homepage** - Navigation and element visibility
- **Authentication** - Login, signup, and form validation
- **Products** - Product browsing, search, and cart operations
- **Cart** - Cart management, quantity updates, checkout flow
- **Contact** - Contact form submission and validation
- **E2E Workflows** - Complete user journeys
- **Visual Regression** - Percy AI-powered visual consistency checks (requires credentials)

## 📦 Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests headlessly
npm test

# Run in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Run in specific browser
npm run test:chrome
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:safari
npm run test:edge

# Visual regression tests (requires Percy credentials)
npm run test:percy               # Percy AI-powered visual tests
npm run test:percy:all           # All tests with Percy

# View test reports
npx playwright show-report
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Page Object Model

All pages follow a consistent structure with selectors (getters) at the top and actions (methods) at the bottom.

```
pages/
├── BasePage.ts         # Base page with common functionality
├── HomePage.ts
├── LoginPage.ts
├── ProductsPage.ts
├── CartPage.ts
└── ContactPage.ts
```

### Custom Fixtures

Tests use fixtures for clean, fast execution:

```typescript
test('should display login form', async ({ loginPage }) => {
  await expect(loginPage.emailInput).toBeVisible();
});
```

## 📋 Coding Standards

See `CODING_STANDARDS.md` for details. Key principles:

- Getters for locators (lazy evaluation)
- Role-based locators prioritized (`getByRole()`)
- Selectors and actions separated
- Custom fixtures for page objects
- No useless comments
- Playwright community standards

## 📊 API Testing Philosophy

**API testing is intentionally excluded** from this Playwright project. API endpoints should be tested with more efficient tools:

- **Jest + Supertest** - Fast, lightweight API testing
- **Postman/Newman** - Contract and integration testing
- **REST Assured** - For Java-based API testing

**Why?** API tests run faster without browser overhead, and separation of concerns allows E2E tests to focus on user journeys while API tests validate backend contracts independently.

**Testing Strategy:**
```
E2E Tests (Playwright) - 10%       ← This Project
Integration Tests (Jest) - 20%
API Tests (Jest/Supertest) - 30%   ← Use separate tools
Unit Tests (Jest) - 40%
```

## 🎨 Visual Testing

The project uses **Percy** for AI-powered visual regression testing. **⚠️ Requires `PERCY_TOKEN` credentials.**

### Quick Setup

1. Sign up at [percy.io](https://percy.io) and create a project
2. Get `PERCY_TOKEN` from Project Settings → API Tokens
3. Add to `.env`: `PERCY_TOKEN=your_token_here`
4. Run: `npm run test:percy` or `npm run test:percy:all`

### How It Works

- **First run**: Creates baseline snapshots in Percy dashboard
- **Subsequent runs**: AI compares new snapshots against baselines
- **Differences**: Shown in dashboard with approval workflow
- **Benefits**: Ignores insignificant differences (fonts, shadows), cross-browser testing, visual dashboard

### Configuration

Customize snapshots in `tests/percy-visual.spec.ts`:
```typescript
await percySnapshot(page, 'Snapshot Name', {
  widths: [1280, 375],  // Viewport widths
  percyCSS: '.hide { display: none; }',  // Hide elements
});
```

### CI/CD

Add `PERCY_TOKEN` as secret environment variable. Example (GitHub Actions):
```yaml
- run: npm run test:percy
  env:
    PERCY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERCY_TOKEN }}
```

**Test File:** `tests/percy-visual.spec.ts` | **Docs:** [Percy Documentation](https://docs.percy.io/docs/playwright)

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

**Current Configuration:**
- Parallel test execution (configured in `playwright.config.ts`)
- Retries for flaky tests (2 retries on CI)
- Traces and screenshots on failure
- Percy visual testing integration (requires `PERCY_TOKEN` secret)
- Separate API tests into dedicated CI jobs for speed

**Settings:**
- `forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI` - Prevents test.only in production
- `retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0` - Retries on CI only
- `workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined` - Sequential on CI, parallel locally

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- **Demo workflow included** - `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` demonstrates CI/CD setup
- Runs tests on push/PR to main/develop branches
- Includes caching, artifact uploads, and proper CI configuration
- **Note:** This is a demonstration workflow. Customize for your production needs.

**Future Plans:**
- Matrix builds for cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test result reporting and notifications
- Integration with project management tools
- Parallel test execution optimization for faster CI runs

## 🍪 Cookie Consent Popup Handling

The site uses cookie consent popups that can block interactions. 

1. **localStorage injection** - Attempts to set consent before page loads (in `fixtures.ts`)
2. **Popup clicking fallback** - Clicks accept button if popup appears (in `BasePage.ts`)
3. **Retry mechanisms** - 2 retries on CI handle transient failures

**In production:** Identify the exact cookie/storage key via browser DevTools, then inject it via `context.addCookies()` or global setup for maximum reliability.
